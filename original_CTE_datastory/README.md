# CTE_datastory

## Individual vizs serve and develop (NOT used anymore)

The main viz code is in state.html, in the `datastory` folder. First launch any http server to serve the files, then navigate to the URL(directory) of the page you want to see.

For example, with Python installed, you can change directory to the top level CTE_datastory, then run
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in terminal.

Then open `http://localhost:8000/datastory/state.html` in browser to see the map, or `http://localhost:8000/webpage/` to see the story.

## Data Story web app development

The data story web code is in `web` folder. Please navigate inside the `web` folder and find a detailed README there.

You need Node (created with version 12, lower version is not guranteed) and NPM (NPM comes with a standard Node installation) installed first to run the web app.
