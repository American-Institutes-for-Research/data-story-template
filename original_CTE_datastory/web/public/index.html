            Career and technical education (CTE) provides an important pathway to success for high school students and offers
            each student opportunities to personalize his or her education based on their career interests and unique learning needs. CTE
            refers to courses and programs designed to prepare students for careers in current or emerging professions. At the high
            school level, CTE provides students with opportunities to explore a career theme of interest while learning a set of
            technical and employability skills that integrate into or complement their academic studies. High school CTE is meant to
            connect with and lead to postsecondary programs of study or additional training after high school, which may include more
            specialized technical instruction. These pathways can culminate in postsecondary degrees or certificates, apprenticeships, or employment. <a class="md-trigger more-info" data-modal="modal-1">Learn more about CTE<img alt="more detail" aria-hidden="true" src="assets/img/modal-icon.svg"></a>.

          <p>
            A critical workforce challenge in the United States is the skills gap, particularly among jobs that require either a
              high school diploma, postsecondary certificate, or associate&rsquo;s degree.<sup><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></sup>
              Jobs requiring these &ldquo;middle skills&rdquo; outnumber the adults in the workforce who possess them, and
              this gap presents a barrier to American economic competitiveness. There are 30 million jobs in the United States that
              do not require a bachelor&rsquo;s degree that pay median earnings of $55,000 or more.<sup>
                <a href="#_ftn5"
                  name="_ftnref5">[2]</a></sup>&nbsp; CTE provides an important avenue for young adults to gain these skills beginning in
              high school. How do we engage a new generation of young Americans and prepare them for rewarding careers? Last year,
              Congress reauthorized the <em>Strengthening Career and Technical Education Act for the 21st Century</em> (also
              referred to as <em>Perkins V</em>), the federal legislation that supports CTE programs and whose purpose is to address
              these critical issues.<sup><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[3]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p>
            This data story explores both access to and participation in CTE in high school, as well as the outcomes of students who
            concentrate their studies in CTE, using national and state-level data from the Department. <a class="md-trigger more-info" data-modal="modal-3">Learn more about the data sources<img alt="more detail" aria-hidden="true" src="assets/img/modal-icon.svg"></a>.

            While definitions vary by state, the U.S. Department of Education (the Department) issued non-regulatory guidance on
            two
            different measures of student participation in CTE.&nbsp; At the high school level, the term <em>CTE participant</em>
            refers to a student who earned at least one credit in any CTE course. The term<em> CTE concentrator</em> refers to a
            student who earned two or more credits within a single program of study, such as Health Science or Business Management
            and Administration. <a class="md-trigger more-info" data-modal="modal-2">Learn more about CTE participants and CTE

            CTE can offer career exploration and career-building activities in the classroom as well as hands-on learning experiences outside the classroom. Almost all public school districts (98 percent) offered CTE programs to high school students during the 2016&ndash;17 school year, but the activities offered in these CTE programs varied by district. Among districts that offered CTE programs, the most common CTE activity or feature was work-based learning opportunities, such as on-the-job training, internships, practicums, clinical experiences, or cooperative education (77 percent); followed by CTE courses that earned both high school and postsecondary credits, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;dual credit&rdquo; or &ldquo;concurrent credit&rdquo; (73 percent); mentoring by local employers (65 percent); and student-run enterprises or services (55 percent). <a class="md-trigger more-info" data-modal="modal-8">Learn more about public school districts offering dual credit<img alt="more detail" aria-hidden="true"

              (CTE) programs
              for the 2016&ndash;17 school year. The topics covered included entities that provide the CTE programs, the
              locations

              and
              barriers to student participation in CTE programs. The survey was mailed to approximately 1,800 public
              school
              districts with high school grades in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The unweighted survey

            </p>

            <p>
              <strong><u>Consolidated Annual Report</u></strong><br>
              The Consolidated Annual Report (CAR) is a single reporting instrument developed by the Department of Education that
              enables eligible agencies to submit the narrative performance report pursuant to 2 CFR 200.328 and 34 CFR 76.720, the
              financial reports pursuant to 2 CFR 200.327 and 34 CFR 76.720, and the performance data reports pursuant
              to section
              113 of the Perkins Act. Data submission for the previous fiscal year is due by December 31 of each year.
            </p>

            <h5>Data Limitations</h5>
            <p>
              High school graduation rates: In this data story, a CTE concentrator is defined as a student who has
              completed at
              least two course credits in a single career and technical education (CTE) subject, according to the
              student&rsquo;s
              high school transcript(s), while a non-concentrator could be any student who did not meet this criterion.
              Because they
              are required to have completed at least two course credits in a single subject during high school, CTE
              concentrators
              may be more likely to have complete transcript data and/or have completed high school than
              non-concentrators. Please
              use caution when comparing the high school graduation rates of these two groups.
            </p>

            <p>
              Employment earnings (including median earnings): The analysis of employment earnings in this data story
              includes all
              students in the sample who have data available. It is not restricted to students who were working full
              time and full
              year. Due to differences in employment status between CTE concentrators and non-concentrators, please use
              caution when
              comparing the earnings data of these two groups.
            </p>

            <h5>Note on significant differences</h5>
            <p>
              Only statistically significant differences (at p &#60; .05) are discussed except where noted. If differences between groups are not statistically significant, we use the phrase “no measurable difference.”

          This data story examines the percentage of public high school students who earned at least two CTE credits in

          single CTE program of study or career cluster (these students are referred to as a CTE concentrator in this
          data
          story), as measured by the cohort CTE concentration rate. We calculate the cohort CTE concentration rate by
          identifying the &ldquo;cohort&rdquo; of first-year high school students in a particular year. The CTE
          concentration
          rate is the percentage of students in this cohort who earned at least two CTE credits within the standard
          number of
          years in high school. Because this data story used a variety of data sources to highlight important aspects of
          CTE
          participation and outcomes, the cohorts were defined in different ways, as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>National participation data were based on a longitudinal study using a nationally-representative sample
              of a

              Center for
              Education Statistics (NCES), Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education. The cohort
              consisted of
              9th grade public high school students in 2009&ndash;10 and followed up with a collection of high school
              transcripts
              in 2013 to examine course credits earned over the study period. The study included over 23,000 9th graders
              from 944
              schools in 2009.</li>
            <li>National outcome data were based on a longitudinal study using a nationally-representative sample of a
              cohort of
              students from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:02), conducted by the National Center for
              Education
              Statistics (NCES), Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, to permit analysis of
              longer-term
              education and labor market outcomes. The cohort consisted of 10th grade public high school students in
              2001&ndash;02
              and followed up with a collection of high school transcripts in 2004 to examine course credits earned over
              the study
              period. The study included over 12,000 10th graders from 750 schools in 2002.</li>
