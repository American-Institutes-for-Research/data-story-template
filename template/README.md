# Development and Deloyment Guide

## Development

Sometimes in the HTML files, you might need to comment out the 'uglified/min' version of JS or CSS tags, and uncomment the original JS/CSS tags for you to develop.

Don't modify the 'uglified.js[css]/site.min.js' files manually. These are generated by node script.

## Deploy compressed JS and CSS to production

Or, if you've included a new library, you'll also to generate new production script/stylesheet.

Do the following:

1. you need to install Node and NPM first
2. in your terminal, cd into the 'build' folder
3. run 'npm install'
4. in your editor, edit 'uglify.js' so that it includes your newly added script/stylesheet (keep the order you include them on page)
5. in your teminal, run 'node uglify.js' 
  -- this produces a 'uglified.js', a 'uglified.css', and a 'site.min.js' in the 'build/prod' folder
  -- these files are minified version of all JS/CSS used by the site
6. in your HTML files (for both site index.html and each of the vizs), uncomment (and comment out) the proper 'script' tags and 'link' tags to point to the uglified/minified version
7. deploy 'index.html', 'build' folder, 'visualizations' folder, 'web' folder to your server (for GitHub pages, or depending on your server settings, you might need to remove 'node_modules', 'packadge.json', 'uglify.js' in the 'build' folder)
