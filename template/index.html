                    In today’s era of technological innovation, students need to gain knowledge and skills in order to
                    solve difficult problems, gather and evaluate evidence, and make sense of information they receive.
                    Students can develop and strengthen these skills by studying science, technology, engineering, and
                    mathematics, or STEM, subjects.<sup>1</sup>

                    STEM education is embedded in the U.S. Department of Education’s (the Department's) mission. The
                    Secretary of
                    Education has outlined a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/03/02/2018-04291/secretarys-final-supplemental-priorities-and-definitions-for-discretionary-grant-programs"

                    the
                    STEM areas, including expanding access to STEM and computer science courses for all students.
                    Additionally, in September 2017, the President signed a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-secretary-education/"
                        target="_blank">Presidential
                        Memorandum</a> designed to increase

                    While a number of different subjects fall under the STEM umbrella, Algebra I is the focus of
                    this data story because it is seen as a gatekeeper course. A student must generally complete
                    Algebra I
                    in order to take higher level STEM courses.

                    these classes. While the Department is working to increase both access to and enrollment in STEM
                    courses, as we will see through the story, students who have access to Algebra I classes do not
                    necessarily enroll in them.

                    A typical math course sequence would start with Algebra I and continue with Geometry, Algebra II,
                    Pre-Calculus, and Calculus. Students who do not have access to Algebra I until high school will

                    Nearly 90 percent of students enrolled in magnet schools had access to Algebra I in 8th grade,
                    compared
                    to less than 20 percent of students enrolled in special education schools. This wide variation
                    shows
                    that students’ access to STEM education can be greatly impacted by the type of school they attend.

                    In addition to the benefits of taking high-level math courses, research also shows that students

                    completed Algebra I earlier completed a range of science courses by the end of high school.<sup>5</sup>
                    Since
                    high-level mathematics and high-level science courses are frequently taken together, students who
                    have
                    the opportunity to take more advanced math courses are also more likely to take advanced science
                    courses. However, some research shows a negative impact of universal 8th-grade Algebra policies on
                    students’ math achievement in high school.<sup>6</sup>

                    Previously, we saw that 80 percent of 8th-grade students had access to Algebra I in 8th grade;
