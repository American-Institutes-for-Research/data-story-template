            In today’s era of technological innovation, students need to gain knowledge and skills in order to solve
            difficult problems, gather and evaluate evidence, make sense of information they study, and be prepared
            for the careers and challenges of the
            21<sup>st</sup> century and beyond. Students can develop and strengthen these skills by studying science,
            technology,
            engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects, including computer science (CS).<sup><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

            Mathematics has been called the “language” of STEM because students need a strong mathematics foundation
            to succeed in STEM fields and to make sense of STEM-related topics in their daily lives.<sup><a href="#_ftn2"

                [2]
              </a></sup> This story focuses
            on Algebra I within K-12 education because it is seen
            as a gatekeeper course: Students normally need to complete Algebra I in order to take higher level
            mathematics and science courses.<sup><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></sup> Taking the course earlier in their academic careers allows students sufficient time to take
            the more advanced courses that are often prerequisites for postsecondary STEM majors. However, we see in
            this data story that
            only 24 percent of all 8<sup>th</sup> graders are enrolled in Algebra I. <a class="md-trigger more-info"

            the students who actually enroll in these classes, particularly in 8<sup>th</sup> grade. The Department is
            encouraging
            both access to and enrollment in STEM courses. Both aspects are important because, as we will see through
            the story, even where access to Algebra I classes are available students do not necessarily enroll in them.

            Despite the benefits of early access to Algebra I, we see that only 59 percent of schools that serve 8<sup>th</sup>
            graders offer Algebra I. A typical math course sequence would start with Algebra I and continue with
            Geometry, Algebra II,
            Pre-Calculus, and Calculus. Students who do not have access to Algebra I until high school are unlikely to
            have the opportunity to take any Calculus courses before they graduate.

            Since high-level mathematics and high-level science courses are frequently taken together, students who
            have the opportunity to take more advanced math courses are also more likely to take advanced science
            courses. When schools don’t offer Algebra I to
            8<sup>th</sup> graders, it can reduce the amount of all STEM courses - not just math courses - they can
            take
            before graduation.

            Schools that offer Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup> grade provide their students with an opportunity to reach
            more advanced math and science courses in high school. However, there is a wide variation in students’
            access to Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup> grade based on where the school is located and the type of school

            8<sup>th</sup> grade students and the schools that serve them.

            While 59 percent of schools offered Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup> grade, these schools served 80 percent of

            school that
            offered Algebra I. The percentage
            of 8<sup>th</sup> graders who had access to Algebra I was largest for students attending magnet schools,

            school with nearly 20 percent of students having access to Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup> grade. This wide variation

          <p>
            While access to Algebra I is important, access alone is not enough. Students will not reap the benefits of
            <em>access</em> to more STEM courses if they are not actually <em>enrolled</em> in the courses.

            There are many factors within a school that may affect how many, and which, students are
            enrolled in Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup> grade. For example, some students have access to Algebra
            I in 7<sup>th</sup> grade,
            some students may not be ready to take Algebra I in 8<sup>th</sup> grade, and others may not be interested

            Although over 8,000 districts offered access to Algebra I, in almost 90 percent of districts, less than
            half of all 8<sup>th</sup> graders were enrolled in the course. We also see differences in enrollment by
            state, with Minnesota and Pennsylvania,
            for example, standing out as states with broad enrollment. <a class="md-trigger more-info" data-modal="modal-5">Learn

            <p>
              The data explored in this story comes from the <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-2015-16.html">Civil Rights
                Data Collection (CRDC)</a>. Since 1968, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) has conducted the CRDC to
              collect data on key education and civil rights issues in our nation's public schools. The CRDC collects a
              variety of information including student enrollment and educational programs and services, most of which
              is disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, limited English proficiency, and disability. The CRDC informs
              the Office of Civil Rights’ overall strategy for administering and enforcing the civil rights statutes
              for which it is responsible. The CRDC collects data only
              from public schools and does not include data from private
              schools. To directly download the CRDC data files, click <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/2015-16-crdc-data.zip">here</a> (34MB).
            </p>

            <h5>Data Exclusion Rules</h5>
            <p>
              Data included in this story may differ slightly from other published reports due to certain data
              decisions. For the purposes of these analyses, schools with incomplete or inconsistent data values were
              excluded as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
              1. Less than 1% of schools were excluded from all analyses because they reported inconsistent data for
              Algebra I enrollment for the same grade level.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. An additional 6% of schools serving 8<sup>th</sup> grade students were excluded from all enrollment
              analyses due to missing 8<sup>th</sup> grade enrollment data or the 8<sup>th</sup> grade Algebra I
              enrollment count being larger than
              the 8<sup>th</sup> grade overall enrollment.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Fewer than 10 schools were excluded from the enrollment by urbanicity (locale) analysis due to missing
              data.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Schools with an 8<sup>th</sup> grade Algebra I enrollment count larger than the 8<sup>th</sup> grade
              enrollment for either the male or female subgroup (1% of schools serving 8th-grade students) were
              excluded from the enrollment by gender
              analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
              5. Schools with an 8<sup>th</sup> grade Algebra I enrollment count larger than the 8<sup>th</sup> grade
              enrollment for at least one race/ethnicity subgroup (16% of schools serving 8<sup>th</sup> grade
              students) were excluded from the enrollment
              by race/ethnicity analysis.

          “the overall effect of taking algebra by 8th grade is to increase the probability that students will pass
          Algebra I by 10th grade, but to depress their performance on the Algebra I test and decrease the likelihood
          they will pass Geometry by 11th grade…We find that the harmful effects are almost entirely confined to
          students in the bottom 60% of the prior achievement distribution”.

        <blockquote>“Enrollment in algebra or higher was associated with higher mathematics scores on the assessment
          given at the end of the eighth grade, and this was true within each subgroup category—sex, race/ethnicity,
          poverty status, mother’s education, family type, region, school type, and school’s algebra enrollment
          (e.g., Black students in algebra or higher courses outperformed Black students not in algebra).”</blockquote>
