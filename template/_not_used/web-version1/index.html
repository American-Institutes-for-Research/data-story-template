                <span class="drop-cap">I</span>n today’s era of technological innovation, students need to gain knowledge and skills in order to
                solve difficult problems, gather and evaluate evidence, and make sense of information they receive. Students
                can develop and strengthen these skills by studying science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subjects,
                otherwise known as STEM (
                <a href="https://www.ed.gov/Stem" target="_blank">https://www.ed.gov/Stem</a> ). A strong STEM education is a basic right for all students. As the demand for
                new skills grows, we must prepare students to develop innovative solutions for the challenges of the 21st
                century.
            </div>
            <div class="col-12 intro-text">
                A strong STEM education is increasingly recognized as a path to employment. The need for STEM knowledge and skills will grow
                and continue into the future (
                <a href="https://innovation.ed.gov/files/2016/09/AIR-STEM2026_Report_2016.pdf" target="_blank">https://innovation.ed.gov/files/2016/09/AIR-STEM2026_Report_2016.pdf</a> ). STEM education is a priority
                for the U.S. Department of Education. The Secretary of Education has outlined a comprehensive education agenda
                that includes “Promoting Science, Technology, Engineering, or Math (STEM) Education with a Particular Focus
                on Computer Science” as a key priority (
                <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/03/02/2018-04291/secretarys-final-supplemental-priorities-and-definitions-for-discretionary-grant-programs"

                ). This priority focuses on expanding access to STEM and computer science courses for all students. According to the Office
                of Innovation and Improvement, more than half of all STEM jobs in 2018 will be in computer-science related
                fields. Computer science knowledge will help prepare students for the changing economy (

            <div class="col-12 intro-text mb-3">
                While a number of different subjects are encompassed under the STEM umbrella, Algebra I is particularly important and is
                the focus of this data story. Algebra I is a gatekeeper course; a student generally must complete Algebra
                I in order to take math and science classes that require advanced math. In addition, taking Algebra I in
                8th grade enables students to take a greater number and range of STEM courses than if they complete Algebra
                I in 9th grade or later because it is typically a prerequisite for more advanced courses. For instance, a
                typical math course sequence starting in 8th grade and ending in 12th grade would include Algebra I, Geometry,
                Algebra II, Pre-Calculus, and Calculus. If a student doesn’t take Algebra I until 10th grade, they typically
                will not take any Calculus before they graduate high school. High- level mathematics and high-level science
                are taken together frequently (
                <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2018/2018118.pdf" target="_blank">https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2018/2018118.pdf</a> ), so students who have the opportunity to take more advanced
                math courses are also more likely to take advanced science courses. A typical science course sequence may
                include Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Environmental Science. However, alternative sequences for science
                courses are more common.

                            This data story explores both access to and enrollment in Algebra I using the 2015–16 Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC).
                            In terms of <b>access</b>, this data story looks at the types of schools that offer Algebra I classes
                            and the students who have access to those courses because they are enrolled in those schools.
                            In terms of <b>enrollment</b> this data story further drills down to explore the students who actually
                            enrolled in Algebra I classes that are offered. As we will see through the story, just because
                            students have access to Algebra I classes does not mean they actually enroll in those classes.

                <p class="mt-5">
                    The data we have explored in this story come from the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC). The CRDC collects a variety of
                    information including student enrollment and educational programs and services from our nation’s public
                    schools. It has been conducted by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) under the Department of Education
                    since 1968. Most of the data collected in CRDC are disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, limited English
                    proficiency, and disability.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-5">
                    The 2015–16 CRDC collected data from nearly every public school in the country and for the first time, it collected data
                    on Algebra I classes and enrollment in middle schools. This provides a unique opportunity to examine
                    the current state of class offering and student enrollment in these early math courses and how they compare
                    by student and school characteristics and by community.

                <p class="mt-5">
                    Algebra I is used as an important indicator in consolidated state plans. Under section 8302 of the Elementary and Secondary
                    Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), states must submit
                    a consolidated State plan to provide information about how the ESEA, as amended by the ESSA, will be
                    implemented in their state. Many states cited taking Algebra I classes or passing Algebra I exams as
                    an outcome measure for their goals. Some examples are:
                </p>

                    <li class="mb-3">
                        States including Arizona, Virginia, Maryland, and Mississippi will continue to provide every student the opportunity to take
                        Algebra I in middle schools, and more states including New Jersey and Tennessee will support district’s
                        effort to increase Algebra I taking in middle school.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-3">
                        To measure high school math performance and participation in Virginia, the cohort rate will be calculated based on the number
                        of students who took the Algebra I test.
