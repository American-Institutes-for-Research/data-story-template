# A data story template based on [STEM](https://www2.ed.gov/datastory/stem/algebra/index.html)

> The actual web template is in the `template` folder. Please create another folder for other things that you want to push to this repo.

The template intends to not use any framework so that the client can pick it up easier, taking into consideration of their skillset.
