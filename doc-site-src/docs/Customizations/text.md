# Edit texts

The easiest way to find the text you want to edit is to use a code editor's search feature. As long as you do not change any text's surrounding HTML element, it should retain the same style.

It is also very helpful to learn how to use the browser's developer tool to inspect HTML elements, so that you can directly locate the element you want to edit.
