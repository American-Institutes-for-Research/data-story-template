# Add or remove elements

The key to add or remove elements in the HTML document is to locate the element correctly. We'll use the browser DEV tool inspector to do that.

Once you find the element, select all of it, paste it to somewhere in the HTML document & customize; or delete it.

<details>
<summary>Excercise</summary>

1. Add a section title for the first paragraph

A section title looks like this:

![Image of title](/img/tutorial/title-generic.png)

2. Add one or more paragraphs (hint: sometimes you can just update the text inside the element that's already there)

(please refer to `/template-excercise-material/HEERF Reporting OCDO Blog Entry v0.2 - Copy.docx`)
