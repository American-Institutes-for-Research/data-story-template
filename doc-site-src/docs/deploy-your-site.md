# Deploy the site

The data story template is a **static website**.

It is just simple **static HTML, JavaScript and CSS files**.

## Where to deploy

Once your site runs well locally, you can now deploy the content in the `template` folder **almost anywhere** easily, **for free** or very small cost.

Usually you just need to copy & paste all the files and upload them to the hosting service you choose.

Some great, easy to use, and free services are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (This is where this tutorial is deployed.)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

Or just [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (more technical to use).
